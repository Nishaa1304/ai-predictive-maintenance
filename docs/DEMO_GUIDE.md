### 3. Live Demo Part 2: Voice Agent Call (2-3 minutes)

**Show:**
1. **Trigger voice call simulation**
   - Play pre-recorded voice call OR
   - Use text-to-speech live

**Voice Script:**
```
Agent: "Hello, this is your vehicle's AI assistant. 
        We detected that your alternator may fail within 
        the next 3 days. To prevent a breakdown, we recommend 
        scheduling a quick check-up. Would you like me to 
        book an appointment at a nearby service center?"

Owner: "Yes, please."

Agent: "Great! I found a service center 5 km away with 
        availability tomorrow at 10 AM. Should I book it?"

Owner: "Yes, that works."

Agent: "Perfect! Your appointment is confirmed. You'll 
        receive a text message with the details. Drive safe!"
```

**Script:**
"Notice how the AI explains the problem in simple terms, checks availability, and books automatically—all without human intervention."

### 5. Live Demo Part 4: Feedback & Manufacturing Insights (2 minutes)

**Show:**
1. **Post-service feedback**
   - Voice agent asks: "How was your service?"
   - Sentiment analysis

2. **Manufacturing Portal**
   - Show RCA report
   - Display pattern: "100 vehicles from Batch X showing alternator overheating"
   - CAPA recommendation: "Consider design modification"

**Script:**
"After service, we collect feedback to improve customer experience. More importantly, if multiple vehicles show the same issue, we alert the manufacturing team so they can fix it in future models."

---

### 6. Live Demo Part 5: UEBA Security (1 minute)

**Show:**
1. **UEBA Dashboard**
   - Show agent activity monitoring
   - Simulate anomaly detection
   - Show alert & blocking action
